**How ruhiy can help you**
Be the best version of yourself

Staying on top of your daily life can be overwhelming, especially as a Muslim. ruhiy uses principles from behavioral science to create a user experience that helps you take control of your life. Our platform goes beyond the foundational tools you need to practice your faith as a Muslim. We offer a truly unique experience by tailoring the content to what is most important to you on any given day.

As a QA professional, I conducted automated tests on the web portal and executed comprehensive black-box testing on the mobile application. The Ruhiy app serves as a personalized Muslim guide, focusing on enhancing users' spiritual and physical well-being.

The app offers a range of functionalities, including tracking religious practices and reading the Quran, prayers, verses, and duas. Additionally, it provides tailored Dua suggestions based on user preferences and mood. The web interface, accessible to the super admin, allows content, user, and event management. The super admin has full control over adding, editing and deleting content like duas, guides, and events. They can also monitor the activities of registered users.

On the mobile platform, registered users can set up profiles, customize preferences, track progress, and access various features such as reading religious content and participating in events. Guest users have limited access, primarily focusing on prayer timings and qibla directions. The app is downloadable from the App Store and Play Store, free from any geographical restrictions.
